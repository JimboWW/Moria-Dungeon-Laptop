Lesson 2 â€” Inspect and change the player symbol

Goal: Locate where the player symbol is defined and change it.

Steps:
1. Open `js/config.js` and find `SYMBOLS.player`.
2. Edit the symbol (for example change `@` to `&`).
3. Save and reload `index1-05.html` to see the change.

Mini exercise:
- Change the player symbol to a different character and commit the change to `feature/change-symbol`.

Notes:
- This is safe to change; it's just a visual symbol in the config.
- If you can't find `SYMBOLS`, search the `js/` folder for `SYMBOLS` or `player`.
